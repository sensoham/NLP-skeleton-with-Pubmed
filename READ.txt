This is an under construction version of core NLP on the pubmed Entrez database.
It contains a lot of redundancies and unpythonic code that will be removed. But somehow this functions.
On running, the processes will generate a lot of csv's and image files. Please do not delete them while the scripts are running since the processes are interdependent.


To use, do the following (after setting the pathways):
1. change the variable 'term' in the script Querrying_biopython_api_NLP.py to whatever you wish to be querried and summarized. (save and close script)
2. run the script run_all_scripts.py

Feel free to imporve, modify or extend.

Regards.
